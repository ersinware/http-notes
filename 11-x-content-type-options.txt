The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should be followed and not be changed. The header allows you to avoid MIME type sniffing by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

In the absence of a MIME type, or in certain cases where browsers believe they are incorrect, browsers may perform MIME sniffing â€” guessing the correct MIME type by looking at the bytes of the resource.
Each browser performs MIME sniffing differently and under different circumstances. (For example, Safari will look at the file extension in the URL if the sent MIME type is unsuitable.) There are security concerns as some MIME types represent executable content. Servers can prevent MIME sniffing by sending the X-Content-Type-Options header.

Blocks a request if the request destination is of type style and the MIME type is not text/css, or of type script and the MIME type is not a JavaScript MIME type.
