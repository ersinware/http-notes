https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin

The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles crossorigin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

Keyword 		Description
anonymous 		Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to 'same-origin'. There is no exchange of **user credentials** via cookies, client-side SSL certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is the same origin.

use-credentials Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and **user credentials** are always included.

""			 	Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or crossorigin="", is the same as anonymous. 

//

Example: crossorigin with the script element
You can use the following <script> element to tell a browser to execute the https://example.com example-framework.js script without sending user-credentials.
<script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
